Needed Classes for factory simulation:
- work station
- task/job (different levels of complexity)
- queue / conveyor belt
- scheduler / controller (controls which task goes to which WS)
- some kind of goal manager (directs scheduler: which goal to focus)
- (Evaluation Module?)
- Monitor/logs

-> controlled system presented in a GUI Interface with possibly user guided tasks (MVP-Pattern for ease of implementation)
-> design internal decision processes as abstract as possible for easier further development

workstation flow:

when( active) wait for task;
got task? -> wait for belt to bring task item;
task item in front? -> do work;
repeat;

belt:

when (active) move along;
when (some WS is working) wait;
repeat;

scheduler:

when (user generated task) put task in queue
every x ms check if goal can be furthered by giving task to certain WS  -> broadcast task + WS responsible + put task item on belt

goal manager:
decide which goal to focus (cost, efficiency, high Utilization,...) in order to increase valuation (keep record of previous valuations and try to keep current v > average past v

(Evaluation module: calculate current valuation, needs to collect data from WS: WS signals start and end of work?)

since last meeting:
- changed clock to not run on system time + fixed previously unknown issue with resetting timer
-

Qs:
do we need multi digit connection costs?


next:
global clock (-> does this fix the weird 5 second stat?)
visualize which task does what step in which station
fix the system to be able to do multiple runs after each other (currently some things go wrong -> see: cheapestStation in scheduler == null)
live update of station costs doesnt work
stations should have multiple possible tasks at different costs
switch stations off and on at runtime through gui
for now: remove change of costs at runtime bc it does not work
