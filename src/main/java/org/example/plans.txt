Needed Classes for Factory simulation:
- work station
- task/job (different levels of complexity)
- queue / conveyor belt
- scheduler / controller (controls which task goes to which WS)
- some kind of goal manager (directs scheduler: which goal to focus
- (Evaluation Module?)
- Monitor/logs

-> controlled system presented in a GUI Interface with possibly user guided tasks (MVP-Pattern for ease of implementation)
-> design internal decision processes as abstract as possible for easier further development
